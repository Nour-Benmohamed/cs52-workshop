 When do you think you might be able to use Bootstrap in the future? When would you not want to?
 

I would be able to use it once I know how to read and understand the code easiler. I would not use it when I have to time to write my own unique style I think. 


 What are some issues/downsides you could run into by using Bootstrap in industry?


just like while doing this tutorial, I didn't know which code should go where exactly.
